                <p>Rosamund Pike, tall, slender and very, very blonde – the blonde of infants and champagne – is dressed in a leather biker jacket, McQueen knitted minidress, tights and Chanel biker boots. “Which I love, but look at this!” She taps at the silver toecap. “It’s coming off. But they’re Chanel!” she exclaims in a deep, melodious timbre. (It is an incredible voice, a voice that should be rallying land girls.) Pike is also toting a tan Loewe handbag with neon leather straps. “It’s the most exciting thing that’s happened to me recently. Apart from my son. Obviously.”</p>

                <p>I didn’t expect funny from Pike, this most elegant and cerebral of British actresses. Nor all this fast-moving, fast- thinking, fast-talking energy (someone get her an Aaron Sorkin script, stat). Nor the frequent and very loud laughter. Nor the fact that occasionally she’s just the tiniest, teensiest bit dippy – at one point holding forth on the various ways one might pronounce the name Helen. It’s all very winning. It’s just that this Rosamund Pike – the real Rosamund Pike – seems rather at odds with the public perception of her.</p>

                </blockquote>
               	<p>As an actress, 33-year-old Pike is tricky to categorise. She’s not a chameleon of the Kate Winslet order, nor does she exude the girl-next-door sexiness of a Sienna Miller. Although entirely gorgeous, hers is not the impregnable, otherworldly beauty of Keira Knightley, and though she has the high brain-wattage of a Rachel Weisz, in Pike it transmutes into something quiet and contained. She seems more akin to a Kristin Scott Thomas: serious and refined. (But this could just be down to cheekbones.) Pike is inured to the idea. As she wrote in Vogue: “I tend to see the world with a kind of screwy humour, which is nonetheless belied again and again by an exterior that people seem to see as reserved and, I don’t know, rather – prim? Cool? Controlled?” In other words, she’s got the mind of Lucille Ball, stuck in Marlene Dietrich’s body.</p>

				<p>In fact, at the moment she’s feeling anything but serene. On the day we meet – also the day of her Vogue photo shoot – she’s in the process of moving house, rehearsing a new movie, trying to get home for bathtime with her baby son, while also attempting to carve out an hour or so for our interview. The shoot is in Dalston, there’s a café nearby where we can go to chat, I offer. “But, hang on, where do you live? West London? Me too. Can we chat in the car?” Done. But before we can talk, there are phone calls to answer – one from her “fella” (50-year- old Robie Uniacke, the father of eight- month-old Solo) who is currently packing up Pike’s rental flat (“poor thing”), and from her mother, who is babysitting her son: “Was he good? Has he eaten?”</p>

				<p>She is so warm and friendly, in fact, it’s easy to forget that Pike began her career at 21, fresh out of Oxford, playing a Bond girl named Miranda Frost – a villainess with a froideur to match her name. Roles in action adventures – Doom and Wrath of the Titans – and fearless on-stage stripping in Terry Johnson’s play Hitchcock Blonde did not concede much opportunity for flexing her funny bone. It wasn’t until Pike took a small part in An Education (so small that her agents were bewildered), displaying expert comic timing as Carey Mulligan’s endearingly dim friend, that casting directors woke up to Pike’s ability to play silly.</p>

				<p>“I’ve been in a lot more comedies, but I haven’t necessarily been allowed to be funny,” she notes of subsequent roles in Johnny English Reborn and The Big Year. “The Big Year was a film with Jack Black, Owen Wilson and Steve Martin, but my character is reading serious books – not to be glib about it – on IVF and infertility. I thought ‘This isn’t right!’” She adds, “The one thing my fella always says to me is, ‘Get directors to let you smile! You’ve got to get a good big smile into the first 30 seconds of every movie you do and it’ll transform everything. Because no one ever lets you.’”</p>


				<p>Not that she’s complaining, not one bit. This month, Pike stars in a very big Hollywood movie, opposite a very big Hollywood star: Tom Cruise. The film, Jack Reacher, is an action-thriller adaptation of airport novelist Lee Child’s One Shot. (You can almost smell the sun lotion coming off the screen.) Cruise, as Reacher, is a grizzled ex-army policeman (a man without rules, a man in a time of men, et cetera), while Pike plays a plucky defence lawyer. “A woman like those in the movies I love, like The Thomas Crown Affair, Three Days of the Condor, films where the woman is much more than a love interest or wife,” Pike says. (There’s not a squeak of sex here.)</p>

				<p>A monster blockbuster, Jack Reacher is a big departure for Pike. But she’s more than a match to the challenge, lending class and wit to a fun, popcorn movie that also features a glorious cameo by indie director Werner Herzog. He plays a criminal overlord who escaped from a Siberian gulag by biting off his fingers. (It’s that kind of film.) “‘Did I have a knife in Siberia?’ Hmm...” says Pike of her attempt at imitation. “My Werner impression needs a bit of work.”</p>

				<p>“Rosamund is a great movie actress. A real movie actress,” emails Herzog. (He even writes in a Teutonic accent.) “And in this film she is in the tradition of the great film-noir women of the past – very often you have the blonde femme fatale, but they are also righteous women. And she somehow picks up effortlessly a great tradition. You have to understand cinema to do what she does. There is something that distinguishes a movie actor from every other actor.”</p>

				<p>That something could be charisma. “Being in a room with someone as famous as Tom Cruise, and they’re doing the thing they’re recognisable for, it’s rather extraordinary,” says Pike. “It’s as if he’s just stepped down off a poster in your teenage bedroom and into the room.” Her audition with Cruise was “a bit like playing a really good tennis match at Wimbledon. Even if you lose, you still got to play on Centre Court.” On set, Pike says, “Tom was great, there’s nothing cool or standoffish about him. I think he understands that he’s Tom Cruise and that it’s exciting for people to meet him.” It was, she says, “one of the most enjoyable experiences of working with a male co-star who was really famous. It’s not always that when you are the supporting actor that you feel really supported by your lead actor.”</p>

				<p>So, he didn’t offer to tutor her in the finer points of Scientology? Pike smiles slowly. “I would love to have... We never talked about it, but I feel he’s the kind of guy who, if I wanted to sit down and have a discussion with him about it, I’m sure would be very open. But I wouldn’t discuss Scientology with him because I don’t know enough about it, I don’t have all the facts,” Pike finishes carefully. “He’s a great boss, so I’m on his team. Team Tom.”</p>

				<p>Pike discovered she was pregnant while filming. “The first thing that goes through your head is you hope you’re not going to be fired, because in this day and age... But they were great about it.” There’s no trace of a baby bump in the skinny pencil skirts Pike wears throughout Jack Reacher, the only hint being one scene in which she hurries down a staircase, pregnancy cleavage jiggling into view. “Oh yes, the bosom,” she groans. “The producer did say he would try not to use that shot, but in the end it was the best take.”</p>

				<p>Life with a newborn is “quite seamless”, she says. Motherhood has had its odd moments, however. “I was in the wine shop in the Eurostar terminal in Paris and there was this woman with a tiny baby. I was missing my son so much I just wanted to get close to this child. It was such a weird feeling. Then of course you’re really close, and suddenly this woman is making protective gestures with her coat and so I had to quickly grab a tin of foie gras and pretend I was shopping,” she says, laughing. “Normally I’d explain that I was simply missing my son, but this woman looked French. Not only would I have been mad, but a mad Englishwoman babbling on in the wrong language.”</p>

				<p>Between Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, we get stuck in a traffic jam. Pike, who’s been chatting fluently since we got in the car, suddenly points at a woman on the pavement who’s scraped something off her shoe and is now examining it. “She’s been studying that tissue for about 10 seconds,” Pike says, fascinated. “That’s a brilliant detail for some character.” She makes a note of it on her iPad. Does she often borrow gestures? “All the time. You can rob things from other people and from your own life. I remember once crying really hard and emitting the most enormous strange animal sound and, in the process of feeling absolutely depressed, thinking, ‘Oh, that’s a strange noise. I might have to use that one day.’” She laughs, horrified.</p>

				<p>We escape the car into a Fulham pub; Pike gets a beep from an appreciative white- van driver as we cross the road. “A toot! I haven’t had a toot in ages!” Inside, she sits directly beneath a beam of light, giving me an opportunity to study skin so pale and peachy, it’s as if she’s lived her entire life under a hat. In her ears hang a pair of gold safety-pin earrings by jeweller Jennifer Fisher. “I was experimenting with putting real safety pins in my ears, but then I found a girl who actually made them.” (See? She’s way more street than one would imagine.)</p>

				<p>But back to the crying. There was a period in Rosamund Pike’s life when the press cast her as a victim of some seriously bad romance. There was some truly ghastly reporting about Pike’s former boyfriend, the actor Simon Woods, who recently married Burberry chief creative officer Christopher Bailey. Then there was the broken engagement to the director Joe Wright.</p>

				<p>“The marriage not working out, and all that?” says Pike, straightening. (She does this every time a question edges into personal territory.) “Yes. I mean, those things are very dramatic.” Big pause. “But I do think my life is resolutely better for all these experiences. Which I can only laugh at me saying, because at the time that’s the thing that people tell you and you can’t see how it could be true.” Does she speak to Wright? “Yes, I’ll see him at a wedding soon. I must watch Anna Karenina before then. He would hate me to watch it on DVD.” And Woods? Not lately. Though: “I care about him enormously,” she smiles.
				</p>

				<p>Putting down roots with Uniacke in north London is, one senses, a big moment for a woman who declares: “Freedom is my buzzword.” Uniacke is perhaps a surprising choice of partner. Rakishly handsome in T-shirt and jeans, and a firm favourite with the society crowd, he has had his fair share of tumultuous relationships, much picked over in the press. Which is why, one imagines, he is prickly about privacy. Not that Pike seems to share his guardedness. “It is interesting to break all the rules. I’m not married, I have a baby, and it feels infinitely more right. You try to do the right thing or the conventional thing, and it doesn’t work, and then you’re free again.” What does she do for fun? “My fella and I go dancing a lot. Not salsa or old-time dancing, we go to raves. When I was filming in South Africa, rather than stay up all night, we would get up early to catch the best DJs at sunrise.” Being a deft writer, it’s no surprise to also working on a screenplay, learn Pike is a comedy about friendship and children. “I showed it to Nick Hornby [who wrote the screenplay for An Education]. I’m able to take criticism – which is just as well, as I’m having to take big criticism,” she says.</p>

				<p>Her next role, as “the girl” in Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright’s comedy, The World’s End, requires her – at last! – to play funny. Says Pegg: “We were looking for someone with comic chops, but we also wanted someone who could turn heads.” In other words, Rosamund Pike redux: a double threat coming to a screen near you.</p>
